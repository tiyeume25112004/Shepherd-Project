<!-- Disclaimer -->
# Disclaimer. ‚ùó<br>
Please read the following information carefully before using this tool!<br>
The content of this repository and the tool therein is for educational purposes and legitimate use cases only.<br>

Do not use this tool excessively as although 'Dorking' and permitted Remote Key-logging may be legal it does have known-functions in the real-world<br>
with regards to cyber terrorism, thefts and blackmail among other malicious activities, which are obviously illegal.<br>

Using this tool is not anonymous, and you need to be aware that Google and your ISP keep logs and knows who you are, where you and not just that but what you've been searching for with this tool.  Dorking, OSint, Recon and Scouting which methodologies are detailed in the CLI tool are all legal practices, but can easily fall into a black-hat/illegal classification if you are not careful with your actions.  I cannot be held responsible for the outcome of your use when using Shepherd.<br>
